# Web Scraping and Crawling with Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This project provides a collection of Python functions for web scraping, crawling, summarization, and sentiment analysis. These functions can be used to extract data from websites, summarize text, and analyze sentiment.

## Main Goal

this project is a broken down version of the initial project with the main goal to help you copy and paste the function that you want to use.


## What is inside

It is not the complete code but just the function and description of what they do and how I've used for.

You will find:
* The web Scrawler
* The web scraper
* The summarizer model
* The sentiment analyzer model

# How to use it

Please make sure to have the necessary packages intall. As this code is intended to be used as a stand by own project, I won't provide a file for install all the packages because you will not need them
